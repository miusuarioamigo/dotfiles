# dotfiles

dotfiles testing on archlinux

##notes for myself
for 'production' version (jajaja) you need to install oh-my-zsh and the following plugins'

- zsh-syntax-highlighting 

- zsh-history-substring-search

- zsh-autosuggestions

Also I thing there are some not-useful stuff in the zshrc file so test it and remove it if you want =P
